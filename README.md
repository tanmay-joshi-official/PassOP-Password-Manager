# 🔐 PassOP – Full Stack Password Manager

PassOP is a full stack password manager built using the MERN stack. It allows users to securely store and manage their website credentials through a clean and responsive interface.

The goal of this project was to practice real-world full stack development by building a functional CRUD application with database integration and modern UI design.

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 Secure Credential Storage
PassOP allows users to store login credentials including website URL, username, and password. All credentials are stored in a database and can be accessed anytime.

---

### ➕ Add New Credentials
Users can easily add new login details by filling out a simple form. Input validation ensures that empty credentials cannot be stored.

---

### ✏️ Edit Existing Passwords
Users can update previously saved credentials. The edit feature loads stored data back into the input fields, making updates quick and user friendly.

---

### 🗑️ Delete Credentials
Users can remove individual credentials whenever they want. There is also an option to delete all stored passwords at once.

---

### 📋 Copy to Clipboard
Each stored credential includes a quick copy button that allows users to copy usernames, passwords, or website links instantly without manual selection.

---

### 👁️ Show / Hide Password
The password input field includes a visibility toggle that allows users to show or hide their password while entering it.

---

### 🔔 Real Time Notifications
The application provides toast notifications for actions like saving, deleting, or copying credentials. This improves user feedback and overall experience.

---

### 📱 Responsive User Interface
The UI is designed using Tailwind CSS and adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

---

### 🎨 Clean and Modern Design
The application uses gradient navigation, soft shadows, and modern layout styling to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.
