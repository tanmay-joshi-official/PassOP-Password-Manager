# 🔐 PassOP – Full Stack Password Manager

PassOP is a **full stack password manager** built using the MERN stack. It allows users to securely store and manage their website credentials through a clean, modern, and fully responsive interface.

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with real-world full stack development, including CRUD operations, REST APIs, database integration, and responsive UI design.
